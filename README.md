# E-commerce Data Clustering
This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that explores and analyzes a dataset related to e-commerce, in addition to an excel sheet of the data and a 'pbix' file that contains
a dashboard by Power BI. The analysis covers various aspects of customer behavior, sales trends, and other business metrics. The goal is to extract actionable insights that could
help in optimizing sales, understanding customer preferences, and improving overall e-commercestrategies using machine learning clustering algorithms like DBSCAN and K-Means.

## Key Features
- Data Cleaning: Pre-processing steps such as handling missing values, data normalization, and feature selection.  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualization and statistical summaries to understand the structure and distribution of the data.  
- Business Insights: Deriving insights on customer purchasing patterns, top-performing products, and seasonal trends.  
- Clustering Modeling: Applying machine learning techniques to cluster customers.
